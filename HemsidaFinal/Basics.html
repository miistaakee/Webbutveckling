                Rust is a brutal, unforgiving game. There’s no tutorial, no directions, and seemingly no one will want to explain everything to you.
                When you first load up the game, take a second to check your settings. Rust is an alpha game, regardless of how good you computer is, at some point you might have performance issues.
                There’s a ton of settings you can tweak to maximize your performance and experience. Some changes may require you to restart your game.  Check out our guide for Improving your FPS in Rust.
                Every second is precious. There’s always resources to be gathered and items to be crafted.
                Make sure you have all the supplies you need to build before you start.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of each wipe, the beaches you spawn on will be filled with nakeds killing each other with rocks. Your first priority is to get out of that clusterfuck and fast.
                While you’re running away, open crates, break barrels, and pick up resources that will be laying around. Crates and barrels will hold crucial components needed to build items and food to keep you alive.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you’re decently far away from the spawn beaches, you’ll need to start gathering resources to build yourself a base.
                You begin with a rock and a torch. The rock is going to be your best friend for awhile, you can hit trees for wood and rock nodes for stone, metal ore, sulfur ore, and high quality metal ore. 
                Wood is the most important to begin with. Get 300 to make yourself a spear, then keep gathering for building supplies.
                Find some rock nodes. They are always one shape, shiny, and will have streaks of silver, gold, or brown. Hit nodes until you have 325 stone; 200 for a stone hatchet and 125 for a stone pickaxe.
                Use hatchets for harvesting wood and animals, pickaxes for harvesting nodes.
                Find and kill an animal with your spear or hatchet. Congratulations, you have made your first successful kill.
                Don’t get too cocky though, quickly harvest it’s body with your hatchet to continue the circle of life.
                If you’re having trouble finding animals, look for hemp plants that will give you 10 cloth and a hemp seed.
                If you find yourself facing a predator, tread carefully. Wolves are very fast and can lock onto you from very far away. Bear’s footsteps can be heard if you’re close enough, these beasts are currently extremely powerful and should be avoided until you have the proper gear and weapons. 
                All animals in Rust currently can run through and up any rocks, regardless of height. Try to sneak up on prey, and hide from predators
